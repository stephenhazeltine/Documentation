DeskMetrics for C++ - Complete API reference
==================================================

You'd probably introduced to DeskMetrics through the :doc:`three minute tutorial<Cplus_3min>`, which cover basic things like downloading our library and DLL, adding it as a reference and making a very simple example using the DeskMetrics platform. If you didn't read it, we recommend reading it before reading the complete documentation.
